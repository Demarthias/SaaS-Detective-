Privacy Policy for SaaS Detective
Effective Date: February 2, 2026

1. Introduction
SaaS Detective ("we," "our," or "us"), a project by Venom Industries LLC, is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information through our Chrome Extension.

2. Information We Do Not Collect
SaaS Detective is designed with a privacy-first architecture.

No Personal Data: We do not collect names, email addresses, physical addresses, or any other personally identifiable information (PII).

No Browsing History: We do not track, record, or transmit your browsing history. The extension only analyzes the technical metadata of the specific tab you are currently viewing to identify the software stack.

No External Transmission: All technology detection is performed locally on your device. No data regarding the sites you visit is sent to our servers.

3. Data Used for Extension Functionality
To provide the core service of identifying website technology, the extension temporarily accesses:

Active Tab Metadata: This is used solely to identify frameworks, CMS platforms, and scripts. This data is not stored or shared.

Local Storage: We use browser-based local storage to save your user preferences (e.g., UI theme or favorite tools). This data stays on your machine.

4. Third-Party Links and Affiliate Disclosure
SaaS Detective may display links to third-party SaaS platforms and services. Some of these links are affiliate links.

If you click an affiliate link, a third-party affiliate network (such as Shopify or MaxBounty) may use cookies or collect technical data (like your IP address) to track the referral.

We do not share any of your browsing data with these third parties. Their data collection is governed by their own respective privacy policies.

5. Future Changes
If we decide to implement anonymized analytics in the future to improve our detection engine, we will update this policy and provide a notification within the extension UI. We will never collect personal data without your explicit consent.
