# SaaS Detective | Web Intelligence Engine
**Version:** 1.0.2 (Manifest V3)
**Core Logic:** TypeScript + JavaScript

SaaS Detective is a lightweight Chrome extension that identifies technology stacks on the current page using local signature matching. No remote calls. No analytics. No tracking.

## Features
- Instant tech stack detection from the current tab
- 90+ signatures across frameworks, analytics, payments, and more
- Organized categories with per-category toggles
- Zero data collection (local-only processing)
- Affiliate links shown only when you click a tool

## Permissions (Why They’re Needed)
- `tabs`: identify the active tab you choose to scan and open links you click in the popup
- `storage`: save category preferences in Chrome sync storage
- Host permissions (http/https): allow the detection script to read page markup for sites you choose to scan

## Build
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```
