## 💎Pro-Analysis Suite
While SaaS-Detective identifies the tech stack, I use these professional tools for Deep-Dive competitor research and SEO audits:
* **[Semrush](https://www.semrush.com)**:The industry standard for analyzing competitor traffic and keyword gaps. (Highly recommended for SaaS developers). 
* **[DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com)**:My preferred infrastructure for hosting high-performance backends and Rust APIs.
